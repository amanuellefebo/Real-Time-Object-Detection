Real Time Object Detection with YOLO 
The real time object detection is one of the most intersting area of computer vision which can be applied in real world problem such as traffic management,
autonomous car and security. The YOLO model are the most powerful real time object detection model which develop by Ultralytics. I use the Yolo11 model
for detection and segmentation of real time objects.
